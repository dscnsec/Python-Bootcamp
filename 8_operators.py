#This is a python script to demonstrate operators

#Arithmetic operators
#Addition
x = 5
y = 3
print(x + y)

#Subtraction
x = 5
y = 3
print(x - y)

#Multiplication
x = 5
y = 3
print(x * y)

#Division
x = 5
y = 3
print(x / y)

#Modulus
x = 5
y = 3
print(x % y)    

#Exponentiation
x = 5
y = 3
print(x ** y)

#Floor division
x = 5
y = 3
print(x // y)

#Assignment operators
#Assigns values from right side operands to left side operand
#x = 5 is a simple assignment operator that assigns the value 5 on the right to the variable x on the left
#x += 3 is a compound assignment operator that performs addition and then assigns the value to the variable x
#x -= 3 is a compound assignment operator that performs subtraction and then assigns the value to the variable x
#x *= 3 is a compound assignment operator that performs multiplication and then assigns the value to the variable x
#x /= 3 is a compound assignment operator that performs division and then assigns the value to the variable x
#x %= 3 is a compound assignment operator that performs modulus and then assigns the value to the variable x
#x //= 3 is a compound assignment operator that performs floor division and then assigns the value to the variable x
#x **= 3 is a compound assignment operator that performs exponentiation and then assigns the value to the variable x

#Comparison operators
#Returns True if the statement is true, otherwise False
#== is equal to
#!= is not equal to
#> is greater than
#< is less than
#>= is greater than or equal to
#<= is less than or equal to

#Logical operators
#and - Returns True if both statements are true
#or - Returns True if one of the statements is true
#not - Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true

#Identity operators
#is - Returns True if both variables are the same object
#is not - Returns True if both variables are not the same object

#Membership operators
#in - Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is present in the object
#not in - Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is not present in the object

#Bitwise operators
#& - Binary AND
#| - Binary OR
#^ - Binary XOR
#~ - Binary Ones Complement
#<< - Binary Left Shift
#>> - Binary Right Shift
